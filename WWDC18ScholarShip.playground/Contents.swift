/* Hi there! Sometimes xcode will not compile the playground on the first run, but a few seconds later will compile and throw no errors, so please give it a few seconds ðŸ˜€
 
 I recommend you to play this playground with a mouse, but playing with a trackpad is also okay, it will just make the game more dificult! 
 
 Also, the drawing view will get laggy if you hold the mouse button down too long, so just release the button once it gets laggy to get back a good framerate.
