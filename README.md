# WWDC18-Scholarship-Submission
Hi there! This is my WWDC18 playground submission. I made a game in which you have to draw an Apple related object, and the computer guesses what it is, and where the computer draws an object and you have to guess what it is. It's like pictionary, but with an AI! So pictionAIry!

I created and trained my neural network myself, and made almost 100 drawings of Apple objects to train the network. The network structure can be seen in the image below:

Here are two screenshots from my playground, one for each of the types of rounds there are in the game:
